# Multi-Step Form Challenge

##Overview
In this challenge, I have created a multi-step form that closely adheres to the provided design. The goal was to ensure a seamless user experience, allowing users to progress through each step, review and update their selections, and confirm their order. Additionally, the interface needed to be responsive, with hover and focus states for interactive elements and form validation messages.

##Project Structure
Here's an overview of how I structured this project:

HTML: I began by creating the HTML structure for the multi-step form, breaking it down into individual sections for each step. This structure made it easier to apply styles and functionality to each step.

CSS: For styling, I used CSS to match the design mockups provided in the /design folder. I organized the CSS to follow a logical order, starting with base styles and progressively adding styles for each section and element. Media queries were used to ensure responsiveness.

Fonts: I chose to host fonts locally using the provided font files. This decision was made to optimize loading speed and maintain design consistency. Font-face declarations were added to the CSS to use these custom fonts.

Assets: All project assets, including images and fonts, are stored in the /assets folder. Images are appropriately sized and optimized for different screens.

##Design Decisions
Responsive Design: To ensure the form works well on various devices, I used media queries to create responsive layouts. The form adapts to both mobile and desktop screen sizes, maintaining a clean and user-friendly interface.

Font Choices: I carefully selected and incorporated fonts that align with the design and provide a visually appealing reading experience. The decision to host fonts locally was made to enhance performance.

Form Validation: I implemented form validation messages to guide users and provide feedback when they miss required fields or incorrectly format their email address.

CSS Organization: To maintain code readability and scalability, I organized the CSS into sections, focusing on base styles first and then refining styles for individual elements.

##Development Process
Project Setup: I initialized the project as a public repository on GitHub for version control and collaboration. This allowed me to easily share my progress with the community.

HTML Structure: I started by creating the HTML structure, defining the form steps and their content. Structuring the HTML first helped me focus on content organization.

Base Styles: I established base styles for the entire project, setting things like font families, font sizes, and color schemes. This created a consistent visual foundation.

Step-by-Step Styling: I followed the mockups in the /design folder to style each step of the form progressively. I ensured that the form matched the design as closely as possible.

Responsive Design: Using media queries, I made adjustments to the layout, font sizes, and padding to ensure the form's responsiveness on various screen sizes.

Form Validation: I implemented JavaScript-based form validation to provide users with clear error messages when needed.

Testing and Debugging: I thoroughly tested the form on different devices and browsers to ensure a seamless user experience. Any issues or bugs were addressed during this phase.

Deployment: I deployed the project using Netlify and made sure the live site was accessible for testing.

##Conclusion
This Multi-Step Form Challenge was an exciting opportunity to practice my front-end development skills and create a user-friendly form that meets design specifications. It allowed me to showcase my ability to structure HTML, apply responsive CSS, and implement form validation for an enhanced user experience. Thank you for reviewing my submission!
